# Version 1.0.x

The Malwarelytics for React Native, Version 1.0.x, has been written from scratch without backward compatibility with older versions; therefore, no special migration steps are required.


## Native Components

The following native Malwarelytics components are used under the hood:

- [Malwarelytics for iOS](https://github.com/wultra/malwarelytics-apple) version `1.2.x`
- [Malwarelytics for Android](https://github.com/wultra/antivirus) version `0.23.x`

It's recommended to use React Native `0.71+` for your application.
