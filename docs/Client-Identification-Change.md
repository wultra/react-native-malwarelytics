# Client Identification Change

Client identification (`clientId` and `deviceId`) can be set in the [configuration](./Configuration.md) to identify the user in the Malwarelytics Console.

Both values can be later changed (or deleted when changed to `undefined`) via:

```js
await Malwarelytics.sharedInstance.setClientId("changedClientId");
await Malwarelytics.sharedInstance.setDeviceId("changedDeviceId");
```
