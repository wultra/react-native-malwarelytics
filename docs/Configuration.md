# Configuration

The minimum configuration for the Malwarelytics is setting up the username, password and the public key in service configuration (for each each platform). However, we recommend configuring all features that are present in the SDK.

<!-- begin box info -->
The `Username`, `Password` and `Signature Public Key` can be obtained in [the Malwarelytics console](https://app.malwarelytics.com/sdk-download). Note that these credentials are bound to your application Package Name/Bundle ID. If you need to support multiple environments (Package names/Bundle IDs), you need different credentials for each environment.
<!-- end -->
## Environment

Malwarelytics offers two environments `PRODUCTION` (default value) for production builds. And `TEST` for development and test builds. The environment can be altered globally or on per-platform basis. Different environments require different access credentials.

## Configuring the Malwarelytics

To enable Malwarelytics in your React Native app, you need to call the `initialize` method with the following configuration object. All properties are optional:

```typescript
import { Malwarelytics } from 'react-native-malwarelytics';

await Malwarelytics.sharedInstance.initialize({
    // Global environment applied to both platforms. Default value is 'PRODUCTION'
    environment: 'PRODUCTION',
    // Following object provides optional client identification. If such values are not available at application's
    // startup, then you can set it to Malwarelytics later. The purpose of identifiers are to identify your users
    // or their devices in the Malwarelytics Console.
    clientIdentification: {
        clientId: 'your-client-id',     // Client's identifier (for example e-mail)
        deviceId: 'device-id',          // Device's identifier if you have some recognized in your systems.
    },
    // The 'apple' section configures Malwarelytics for Apple platforms. 
    apple: {
        // The 'service' section defines connection to Malwarelytics Service for Apple platforms. You can obtain
        // all configuration values in the Malwarelytics Console.
        service: {
            username: "your-username-for-ios app",
            password: "your-password-for-ios app",
            signaturePublicKey: "your-sign-pk-for-ios-app",
            environment: 'TEST' // Environment specific for Apple platform, overrides the global environment set above.
        },
        // The 'rasp' section defines behavior of RASP module for Apple platform. Most of the features supports
        // three basic actions - 'NO_ACTION' (SDK will do nothing), 'NOTIFY' - SDK will notify you via the listener,
        // 'EXIT' - SDK will terminate your application. If exit is specified then you can provide additional 
        // `exitUrl` that is opened in the browser after the application is closed.
        // The typical default action is 'NOTIFY'.
        rasp: {
            // Action defined when jailbreak is detected on the device.
            jailbreak: { action: 'EXIT', exitUrl: 'https://wultra.com/?exit=jailbreak' },
            // Action defined when debugger is detected. On top of default actions you can specify 'BLOCK' action
            // that prevents the debugger to be connected to the process.
            debugger: { action: 'BLOCK' },
            // Action defined when device's screen is being captured.

        }
    }
});
```

## Customer Grouping and Naming

The SDK allows passing custom values that are used to group data in the Malwarelytics web console application.  
The configuration items in `android.customerGrouping` and `android.customerGrouping` add extra metadata that is passed into the web console. The options allow you to split data into groups and obtain different views on the data.

Limitations for the strings are following:  

- Max length of the `sourceBundleId`/`sourcePackageName` is 255 characters  
- Max length of the `appBundleId`/`appPackageName ` is 255 characters  
- Max length of the `audienceGroupId`/`audienceGroupId` is 20 characters  

The main grouping of the data is achieved with `sourceBundleId`/`sourcePackageName`. The value has to agree with the application credentials in the web console.  
The extra granularity of data views is achieved with `appBundleId`/`appPackageName`.  
The last option `audienceGroupId` is used to distinguish users from different customer systems such as "RETAIL", "CORPORATE" and so on.


## Configuration change

Any configuration change of Malwarelytics for React Native requires releasing `Malwarelytics` instance and re-initializing with a new configuration. `AppProtection` instance can be released by calling:

```typescript
Malwarelytics.sharedInstance.shutdown()
```

<!-- begin box warning -->
Malwarelytics for React Native cannot be used after release. It has to be re-initialized first.
